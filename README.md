# tempus
---

Tempus is a small PHP snippet built to swap content out based on manually set dates. Rather than storing this information on the server or following the server time, it takes your local computer time and decides what to show. 

The main example is a single file, with an example found in the */example*/ folder. 

In Latin, tempus means 'time'. To be perfectly honest, I like naming things so I can remember them and so this snippet is simplied called tempus (time) because it hands the timed content, in a manual, custom PHP way.

## File Directory

This is written in PHP, so that is a requirement for it to work on your server.

*tempus.php* Primary usable file. Ready to use, now.

*README.md* This file.

*/example/index.php* Folder containing one example, for a concert venue that shows the next upcoming concert after the previous concert date has past. This is a super simple example, but should give you an idea of how it works.
